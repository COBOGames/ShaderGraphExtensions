Custom nodes for Unity Shader Graph

## CGPanner Node
CGPanner is a simple node for **scrolling textures over time**. It **simplify the multiplication** between a **Tiling Offset** and a **Time** node.
The node is located under Assets/ShaderGraphExtensions/CGPanner/Editor/CGPannerNode.cs
The CGPanner folder contains an example Caustics scene with a simple Caustics shader and a scene with three spheres using that shader.
