## CGPanner Node
CGPanner is a simple node for **scrolling textures over time**. It **simplify the multiplication** between a **Tiling Offset** and a **Time** node.

The node is located under *ShaderGraphExtensions/CGPanner/Editor/CGPannerNode.cs*. The CGPanner folder contains an example Caustics scene with three spheres using a simple Caustics shader.
